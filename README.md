# Arduino-Car-Simulation-
I developed and implemented a C++ code to simulate an autonomous light-following car with integrated signal systems using Tinkercad and Arduino. The project features:

Arduino Uno as the main control unit
Light sensors for autonomous navigation
LED signals including yellow indicators for turning left or right
Red LED signals for stopping
Two DC motors for movement control

The car's behavior is governed by the light sensors, allowing it to navigate independently. The signal system enhances its functionality, mimicking real-world vehicle operations with turn signals and stop lights. This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming, Arduino hardware integration, and sensor-based autonomous systems design.
